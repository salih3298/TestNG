TestNG
Class1

TestNG is a framework that allows us to build test cases.

All the test cases are written down under the annotation :
@Test


Testing login functionality
1 go to the website
2 enter username and password
3 click login button
4 verify that you’re logged in

Testing login functionality
1 go to the website
2 enter incorrect username and password
3 click login button
4 verify that you’re not logged in

@BeforeMethod —> runs before every @Test
@AfterMethod —> runs after every @Test

DEPENDS ON
Depends on the method that is dependent on a parent method will only execute if the parent method passes.

ENABLE/DISABLE
Enable = false —> once it’s set to that, the test will be ignored


PRIORITY
Tests are executed in alphabetical order, but yo can prioritize them by adding (priority1,2,3) after @Test,
The highest priority is 0!!! You don’t mention it, it’s by default.

ASSERTIONS

Hard assertions - if an assertion failed, testNG will quit the test case an mark it as failed, it will not proceed
with the rest of the test cases:
Assert.assertTrue() - takes a boolean value
Assert.assertEquals(actual, expected) - takes 2 Strings

SoftAssertions - if an assertion failed, testNG will not quit the test case and proceed with the rest of the test cases,
until it checks all the assertions
Declare the obj of soft assertion
SoftAssert soft=new SoftAssert();
Write down an assertions:
 soft.AssertTrue()
 soft.AssertEquals()
Once assertions are written in the end - soft.AssertAll() the purpose is to compile all the assertions
